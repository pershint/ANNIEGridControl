This file tells you how to write your own submission configuration JSON and
the implemented keys and values usable.

GRIDSOURCE: File to source that will setup the correct UPS products for your
code.  Can be an absolute path, or have the format "./setup_file.sh" if you
pass the bash script as an input file.

SUBMISSION_SPECS: key/value pairs that define the flag and value to be
added in the jobsub_submit command. Default file is set the same as Steven's
job submission bash script.

Note that the output directory specified will have a separate output directory
generated for each job submitted.

FILES_FOR_REPLACING: Directory that contains all template text files that have
entries that need replacing.  For a ToolAnalysis setup, this directory would
be your tool's configuration files.

MAIN_PROGRAM: Path to the main executable your grid job runs. Can be
an absolute path or have the form "./executable" if you feed your entire
program to the grid and compile it withiin the job.
